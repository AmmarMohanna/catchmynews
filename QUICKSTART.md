## Performance Tips

### For Faster Scraping

Edit `backend/app/config.py`:

```python
MAX_SCRAPING_DEPTH = 2  # Reduce from 3
MAX_PAGES_PER_DOMAIN = 25  # Reduce from 50
```

### For Better Results

Use specific keywords and/or descriptive sentences:

```
Good Keywords: "AI, machine learning, neural networks, GPT, deep learning"
Good Sentence: "Articles about artificial intelligence and natural language processing"
Too broad: Just "technology"
```

Tip: Combine both keywords AND a sentence for best results!

## Production Deployment

For production use:

1. Change database password in `.env`
2. Set up HTTPS with nginx
3. Add authentication
4. Enable rate limiting
5. Set up monitoring

See **README.md** for full production checklist.
